# scrapers/__init__.py
#
# This empty file tells Python that the 'scrapers' directory
# should be treated as a "package" or "module".
#
# This allows us to import files from this folder in other scripts,
# for example, in main.py we can now write:
#
# from scrapers.iheartjane_scraper import fetch_iheartjane_data
#
