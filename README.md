# pa-mm-web-scraper
PA Dispensary Data Scraper

This project is a Python-based tool to scrape product data (cannabinoids, terpenes, pricing) from various Pennsylvania dispensary websites.

The goal is to provide a consolidated database for medical patients to find medication that meets their specific needs, mitigating the need to manually check multiple websites.

This is a migration of an original MATLAB-based project.
